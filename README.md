# Generative-Poem-2.0
This is a generative poem based off of the Christmas poem called "Twas the Night before Christmas". I have designend my code so that it would replace several different words within the poem itself with a random word or several words from a list. I have also tried to preserve the sense of rhyming within the poem. I have done only the first half of the poem due to time constraints, but I am very happy with the overall output of my code. Bellow is an example of the output of my code:


Twas the second before Easter, when all through the boathouse
	Not a angel was stirring, not even a a tiny, tiny, tiny mouse;
	The human skulls were hung by the KFC deep fryer with auclair,
	In hopes that my annoying little cousin soon would be repaired,
	The Target employees were nestled all snug in their shed,
	While visions of the apocalypse danced in their very heavy heads,
	And mamma in her car, and I in my map,
	Had just settled down for a long rap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a big explosion made of antimatter,
	I emerged from the bed to see what was the matter.
	Away to the Chipolte, I flew like a an anxious nerd,
	I lazily went to open the shutters and threw up a book whose words were quite blurred.
The rising sun on the breast of the 17-day old snow
	Gave the lustre of a wedding dress fit for a princess to objects embargoed,
	When what to my wondering hands should lean back in fear,
	But a miniture boat and eight tiny peers,
With a little old grandpa so disheveled and non-stick,
	I knew after the fact that it must be St. Prick.
	More rapid than several rabbits tied together his coursers they were to blame,
	And he screeched, and shouted, and called them mean names;
'Now Stinko! Now, Strawberry Poptart! Now, Prancer And former US President Nixon!
	On, Comet! On, Stupid! On, Late Bloomer And Blitzen!
	To the top of the Misty Mountains! To the top of the sprawl!
	Now fly away all!'
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane sigh,
	When they meet with that highschool bully who just won't leave you alone, mount to Shanghai,
	So up to the house-top the entire staff of your local Walmart they drew,
	With the sleigh full of broken glass and needles, and St. Nicholas too.
